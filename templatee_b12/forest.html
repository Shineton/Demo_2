        TORONTO (December 9, 2019) – CTV News Toronto announced today that
        Nathan Downer will succeed Ken Shaw as co-anchor of CTV NEWS AT NOON and
        CTV NEWS AT SIX alongside Michelle Dubé. Downer begins co-anchoring CTV
        NEWS AT NOON tomorrow (Dec. 10), and assumes his full role on Tuesday,
        Jan. 7, following Shaw’s final CTV NEWS AT SIX newscast. “I’m very
        excited to join the anchor desk of Canada’s most-watched local newscast,
        to be part of this incredible team, and to work alongside an exceptional
        journalist in Michelle Dubé,” said Downer. “I’m tremendously honoured to
        uphold Ken Shaw’s legacy of guiding Torontonians through the biggest
        events unfolding in our wonderful city.” “Nathan is a true fan of
        Toronto,” said Shaw. “Even a casual viewer of CP24 sees Nathan’s passion
        for the city and its rich cultures and history. He brings context and
        integrity to the position and I could not be more pleased.” “Nathan is a
        highly skilled journalist and a trusted voice known to viewers across
        the GTA, which makes him the ideal choice as co-anchor of our weekday
        newscasts,” said Michael Melling, General Manager, CP24 and CTV News
        Toronto. “With a wealth of experience, Nathan will continue to inform
        and engage with our viewers on the stories that matter most.” “I’m
        thrilled to welcome Nathan to the anchor desk,” said Michelle Dubé,
        Co-Anchor, CTV News Toronto. “I have long admired his work, both in the
        field and in the studio. Nathan has a genuine passion for newsgathering
        and sharing Toronto’s stories. I’m excited to work alongside him and
        share in his boundless enthusiasm for our city.” More about Nathan
        Downer Most recently an anchor and reporter for CP24 and an anchor of
        LIVE AT FIVE on CTV Toronto, Nathan Downer is an experienced radio and
        television broadcaster. He has covered the city’s most significant news
        stories during his 11 years with CP24, from federal, provincial, and
        municipal elections, to the Bruce McArthur serial killings
        investigation, and the 2019 NBA championship win by the Toronto Raptors.
        Prior to joining the CP24 team, Downer’s work as a reporter for Global
        TV earned him three RTNDA awards in 2005, including a national prize for
        a feature story. His start in TV came as a sideline reporter in 2002,
        where he covered university football and basketball. He often appeared
        as a guest on TSN’s OFF THE RECORD, and was also hired to put pen to
        paper for Raptor Insider Magazine in a feature called “Last Page.” From
        2009-11, Downer was the in-stadium announcer for the Toronto Argonauts.
        Before moving into television, Downer shaped his career as the producer
        and co-host of a weekly sports talk program on FLOW 93-5. His impressive
        performance quickly earned him the coveted position of news director.
        Downer made his debut in the media business in the summer of 2000 as
        co-host and producer of the CHIN radio weekly talk show INSIGHT. Downer
        sees his career in the broadcast industry as a tool he can use to
        inform, engage, and communicate. He enjoys hosting many special
        community events and is an active member of the Canadian Association of
        Black Journalists. He’s also involved with charity work, including Camp
        Jumoke and Helping Hands Jamaica, and is on the Advisory Board for the
        Sickle Cell Awareness Group Ontario. Downer received the Excellence in
        Media Award, a national prize presented by the African Canadian
        Achievement Awards (ACAA) in 2013. In 2012, the Black Business and
        Professional Association (BBPA) honoured Downer with the 2012
        Distinguished Men of Honour Award. He was also presented with Media
        Award of Excellence from Sickle Cell Awareness Group of Ontario in 2011.
